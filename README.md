# Python

is a High-Level Programming Language, with high-level inbuilt data structures and dynamic binding.
It is interpreted and an object-oriented programming language. 
Python distinguishes itself from other programming languages in its easy to write and understand syntax, which makes it charming to
both beginners and experienced folks alike.
The extensive applicability and library support of Python allow highly versatile and scalable so􀈅ware and products to be
built on top of it in the real world.

Guido van Rossum, the original developer of Python, had no idea just what he
was starting when, in late 1989, he decided to spend a few weeks on a hobby programming
project that he could work on while his office at work was closed during
Christmas. He named this language “Python,” not because of a liking for snakes, but
because he was an enthusiastic fan of the British TV comedy show Monty Python’s Flying Circus.

## The Zen of Python
The Zen of Python is basically a list of Python Aphorishm’s written down in a poetic
manner, to best showcase the good programming practices in Python.
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is o􀈅en better than right now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea – let’s do more of those.
