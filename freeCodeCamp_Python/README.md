# Scientific Computing with Python (Beta)
Python is one of the most popular, flexible programming languages today. You can use it for everything from basic scripting to machine learning.
In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, you'll learn Python fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Then you'll quickly ramp up to complex data structures, networking, relational databases, and data visualization.
1. cipher_generator.py - In this project, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in Python, such as variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements.
2. luhn_algorithm.py - The Luhn Algorithm is widely used for error-checking in various applications, such as verifying credit card numbers.By building this project, you'll gain experience working with numerical computations and string manipulation.
